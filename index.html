	<h1><p id="grad1"><i>An Introduction to the Sounds and Spelling of Russian</i></p></h1><hr>



<p>The Russian alphabet can look intimidating at first glance. However, it doesn't take long to see that it isn't much different from the Latin alphabet. The following words are pronounced a lot like they would be in English:</p> 
	
<div>мама 
	
		<audio controls> <source src="C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\site\mama.wav" type="audio/wav"></au></div><br>


<div>кот <audio controls><source src="kot.wav" type="audio/wav"></au></div><br>

<div>тот <audio controls><source src="tot.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></div><br>
<div>том<audio controls> <source src="tom.wav" type="audio/wav"></au> </div> <hr> 
	<p>All of the preceding items are written in the Russian alphabet, yet they're hardly exotic upon closer inspection. Before looking at individual letters more closely, however, there are some key concepts that require further explanation should the student hope to achieve a thorough understanding of Russian phonology.  
	</p>
	<h1><p id="grad1"><i>2. Key Concepts: Softness, Hardness, and Stress</i></p></h1><hr>
	<p>Most Russian consonants appear in pairs; that is, they're either <b>soft</b> or <b>hard</b>. Consider the difference between the following words:</p>
	<div>мать
	  	  <audio controls><source src="mat'.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
</div>
	<div>мат
<audio controls><source src='mat.wav' type="audio/wav"></audio></div> <hr>
	
	<p>The two words sound similar; indeed, the only significant difference is the way the <b>т</b> is pronounced. Although <b>мать</b> seems to have four letters, <b>ь</b> is the <i>soft sign</i>, not a letter. The soft sign serves only to tell you that the preceding consonant is soft, so it shouldn't be perceived as a letter in its own right.The difference between a <i>soft</i> and a <i>hard</i> consonant is the position of the tongue. Listen carefully to the two words and perhaps you will notice that the soft consonant is pronounced with the tongue raised closer to the roof of the mouth (the hard palette) and the lips spread a bit more. In the case of hard consonants, the opposite is true. The absence of a soft sign indicates that the letter is hard by default.</p>
